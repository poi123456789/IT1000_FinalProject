### 1. Target Audience: 
    a. Student who major in IT
    b. People who have interest on computer monitor.
### 2. Brief Introduction of Computer Monitor:
    a. This project is focus on introduction of computer monitor's history. 
    b. A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial form. 
       A monitor usually comprises the display device, circuitry, casing, and power supply. 
    c. The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal 
       display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp 
       (CCFL) backlighting.
    d. Modern computer monitors are easily interchangeable with conventional television sets. 
    e. However, as computer monitors do not necessarily include components such as a television 
       tuner and speakers, it may not be possible to use a computer monitor as a television without external components.
