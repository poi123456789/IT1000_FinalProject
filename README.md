### Project Descripition:
#### This project is focus on introduction of computer monitor's history. A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial form. A monitor usually comprises the display device, circuitry, casing, and power supply. The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting. Older monitors used a cathode ray tube (CRT). Modern computer monitors are easily interchangeable with conventional television sets. However, as computer monitors do not necessarily include components such as a television tuner and speakers, it may not be possible to use a computer monitor as a television without external components.
