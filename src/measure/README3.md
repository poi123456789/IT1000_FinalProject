#### The resolution for computer monitors has increased over time. From 320x200 during the early 1980s, to 1024x768 during the late 1990s. Since 2009, the most commonly sold resolution for computer monitors is 1920x1080. Before 2013 top-end consumer LCD monitors were limited to 2560x1600 at 30 in (76 cm), excluding Apple products and CRT monitors. Apple introduced 2880x1800 with Retina MacBook Pro at 15.4 in (39 cm) on June 12, 2012, and introduced a 5120x2880 Retina iMac at 27 in (69 cm) on October 16, 2014. By 2015 most major display manufacturers had released 3840x2160 resolution displays.
